## Description

**Local Services Connector** is a modern web platform (similar to Urban Company) that helps users **discover, compare, and book** local service providers using **smart filtering** (location, skills, ratings, price). It also includes a **Part-Time Job Marketplace** where students/freelancers can find gigs beyond household services.

Authentication uses **Clerk** and/or **Firebase Auth** for secure, seamless login. **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** powers real-time notifications. Payments (future scope) will plug into **Razorpay** or **Stripe**.
